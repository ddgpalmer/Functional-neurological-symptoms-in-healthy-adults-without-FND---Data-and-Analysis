Please read this information sheet before deciding whether to proceed with the survey.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Symptoms which are functional in nature affect people who are not diagnosed with FND. One example of this is ""the yips"", in sports players, but clinical experience suggests that many people may experience transient functional symptoms without developing FND. This survey aims to ascertain the prevalence of past experiences of these symptoms. We are administering the survey only to attendees of this year's FNDS conference, and members of the FNDS in order to poll people knowledgeable about the phenomenology of functional symptoms.</span></p> <h3>Who Can Participate</h3> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Any attendees of the 5<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Functional Neurological Disorder or members of the Functional Neurological Disorders Society (FNDS) who have <u>not</u> been diagnosed with FND.</span></p> <h3>What Participation involves</h3> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The survey is administered through REDCap and takes 1-2 minutes. All responses are anonymous, and you will not be asked for any identifying information. The questions are unlikely to be upsetting, or to ask for information that is likely to be embarrassing for most people.</span></p> <h3>Your Consent</h3> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you click 'Proceed', at the bottom of this page, you indicate that you consent to participate in the survey. You may exit the survey without completing it, in which case your answers will be discarded. Once you have submitted your answers, you are no longer able to withdraw consent, since your anonymous responses cannot be identified to be deleted.</span></p> <h3>Ethical and Data Safety Considerations</h3> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your privacy and anonymity while participating in this study will be maintained at all times. No personal identifying data will be collected in the survey. Any subsequent publications will not allow identification of any individual. Data will be stored on servers owned and maintained by The University of Queensland in Australia.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This study adheres to the Guidelines of the ethical review process of The University of Queensland and the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research.
